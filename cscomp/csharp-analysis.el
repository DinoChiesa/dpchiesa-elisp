;;
;; This module provides sourcecode analysis to support the cscomp
;; (csharp-completion) module.
;;
;; ------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; The original csharp-completion package I wrote used the semantic
;; package from cedet. According to the description of the semantic
;; package, it is the perfect tool for the job. In practice, semantic is
;; complex, opaque, and brittle.  In general I find it a bloody
;; nightmare to use.  The documentation is absent or useless. Examining
;; the code reveals that it is disordered and haphazard.  In operation,
;; it treats C# namespaces as classes, and no matter what I tried I
;; couldn't get it to treat the namespace as an independent kind of
;; thing. It uses cute names for various features, in lieu of names that
;; actually convey meaning. There are many other problems. Because of
;; all that, it took me a great effort to understand enough to make it
;; somewhat usable for my purpose. But finally, I got there.
;;
;; But then! I upgraded from emacs v22 to 23.2, and semantic blew up.
;; Even the wisent file broke. Back to square one. I have asked for
;; support and assistance multiple times from the author and have never
;; received a response.
;;
;; Rather than once again invest time in working with semantic, I've
;; moved to the Ast magic from SharpDevelop -
;; ICSharpCode.NRefactory.dll.  The documentation for it is no better
;; than that for Semantic, but... it works as I expect it to.  It is
;; doscoverable, and it behaves rationally. It is complete.
;;
;; The .NET Dll is used via the CscompShell, which is a powershell that
;; loads the CscompUtilities.dll. One of the methods in that DLL returns
;; an abstract syntax tree, formatted as a lisp s-expression. It
;; constructs that s-exp using the NRefactory assembly.
;;
;; The way it works is to save the current buffer to a temporary file,
;; then run the syntax analysis on that temporary file, before deleting
;; the temp file.  Then, the code running in powershell loops through all the
;; source elements in the file, and emits a hierarchically arranged set
;; of lisp structures representing those elements.  Each element is
;; known as a "tag", borrowing from the language of the semantic
;; package.  A tag represents a namespace. the namespace tag has
;; children, which are "type" tags. Each type tag may have fields
;; methods and properties as children.  A method has a code block as a
;; child. And so on.
;;
;; This module exports functions that do things with that abstract
;; syntax tree - such as:
;;
;;   - list all of the namespaces in the current buffer
;;   - list all of the types in the given namespace
;;   - list all of the methods/fields/properties for the given type
;;   - list the in-scope local variables for the current point in the buffer
;;   - return the parent tag of a given tag
;;
;; All of this syntax analysis is performed in support of code
;; completion (intellisense).
;;
;; When the buffer changes, a flag is set that indicates that the AST is
;; out of date.  When the buffer stops changing, the analysis is run
;; again. Each analysis takes a second or so for a 1000-line module.

  "This fn gets called by a timer, on a regular interval.  It

sourcecode analysis, by setting `csharp-analysis-syntax-tree-out-of-date'
if appropriate.

A buffer is considered to be out of date when more than
`csharp-analysis-no-changes-timeout' seconds have elapsed since the last
change, and there have been other changes that have been made
during that interval.  This is checked by comparing the current
time to `csharp-analysis-last-change-time', the last change time that is
recorded in `csharp-analysis-after-change-fn'.

If the timeout period has not expired since the last change,
it indicates that the user is actively changing the buffer, eg
typing, and so there's no sense marking the buffer out of date at
the moment.

If the user later requests a sourcecode analysis (abstract syntax
tree, or AST) for the buffer by implicitly invoking
`csharp-analysis-get-analysis', if the sourcecode
analysis has previously been marked out of date, then cscomp
computes a new analysis.  If it is not marked out of date, then
cscomp returns the existing analysis.

When a buffer is initially loaded, the analysis is marked out of
date, so that it is always calculated upon the first request for
it.

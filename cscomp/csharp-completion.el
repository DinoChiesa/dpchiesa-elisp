;;; Commentary:

;; This is a package that performs code-completion or "intellisense"
;; for C# within emacs buffers.  It works on GNU Emacs running on
;; Windows and relies on Windows PowerShell in order to work.

;; Out of Scope for this module: does not do font-lock, indenting,
;; compiling, flymake, or imenu.  These C# things are provided by
;; csharp-mode.el , which is a pre-requisite for this module.

;; This module also does not do type-ahead completion, debugging,
;; profiling, or management of C# project files.  Those are not
;; available anywhere, as far as I know.


;;; Packaging:
;;
;; csharp-completion is delivered as a set of files:
;;
;;     Cscomp.dll - a .NET assembly that performs work in
;;       support of code completion. For example it can enumerate the
;;       set of types in a namespace imported by a using
;;       statement. It can also perform type inference of var types,
;;       aiding in completion for such types. Return values are
;;       delivered in the form of lisp s-expressions. The DLL is
;;       implemented in C#, and is provided with this source code,
;;       licensed under the same terms.
;;
;;     cscomp-base.el - base function, provides cscomp-log function,
;;       which is used by all other elisp modules in this
;;       package. cscomp-log is useful primarily for diagnostic
;;       purposes.
;;
;;     csharp-shell.el - runs the Powershell that loads
;;       Cscomp.dll and manages input to and output from the
;;       shell.
;;
;;     csharp-analysis.el - provides code analysis functions, for
;;       example the ability to enumerate all the import statements
;;       that are relevant to the current scope, or to enumerate the
;;       local variables that are in scope at a given point in a
;;       source code file.
;;
;;     csharp-completion.el - this module, which provides executive
;;       management of the code-completion function.  It provides the
;;       two main elisp defuns that perform code completion, as well
;;       as supporting functions for doing things like parsing the
;;       local code fragment in the buffer to determine what is being
;;       requested, popping up menus containing the list of completions,
;;       and so on.
;;
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; External Dependencies
;;
;;    ICSharpCode.NRefactory.dll -
;;    a .NET assembly that provides sourcecode-analysis capabilities,
;;    shipped as part of SharpDevelop.  This DLL is used by
;;    CsCompUtilities.dll to do syntax analysis.
;;
;;    Windows XP, Vista, or 7
;;
;;    PowerShell 2.0 - this is included in Windows 7, free download
;;        for prior versions of Windows.
;;
;;    GNU Emacs v23.2 or later
;;
;;    cc-mode 5.31.? or later - included in Emacs 23.2
;;
;;    (optionally)  yasnippet, for snippet insertion.  If emacs has
;;    yasnippet loaded, then this completion module will insert
;;    a snippet (template) when the user selects a Method from the
;;    completion list menu.  The method snippet will have all the
;;    method parameters as placeholders; the developer then types over
;;    those placeholders to supply the actual method parameters.
;;    If yasnippet is not loaded, then the completion is just
;;    the method name, and the developer has to fill in the
;;    param-list himself. I highly recommend ya-snippet.
;;
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Set up
;;
;;    To set up csharp-completion:
;;
;;    1. put all the elisp files into a directory, and put that
;;       directory on your load path.
;;
;;    2. put this in your .emacs:
;;
;;       (eval-after-load "csharp-completion"
;;        '(progn
;;           (setq cscomp-assembly-search-paths
;;             (list "c:\\.net3.5ra"    ;; <<- locations of reference assemblies
;;                   "c:\\.net3.0ra"    ;; <<-
;;                     ...              ;; <<- other assembly directories you use
;;                   "c:\\.net2.0"      ;; <<- location of .NET Framework assemblies
;;                   "c:\\.net3.5"      ;; <<- ditto
;;           ))))
;;
;;       The `cscomp-assembly-search-paths' should hold a list of
;;       directories to search for assemblies that get referenced via using
;;       clauses in the modules you edit.  This will try default to
;;       something reasonable, including the "typical" .NET 2.0 and 3.5
;;       directories, as well as the default locations for reference
;;       assemblies.  If you have non-default locations for these things,
;;       you should set them here. Also, if you have other libraries (for
;;       example, the WCF Rest Starter kit, or the Windows Automation
;;       assemblies) that you reference within your code, you can include
;;       the appropriate directory in this list.
;;
;;    3. put this into your csharp-mode-hook:
;;
;;         ;; C# code completion
;;         (require 'csharp-completion)
;;         (csharp-analysis-mode 1)
;;         (local-set-key "\M-\\"   'cscomp-complete-at-point)
;;         (local-set-key "\M-\."   'cscomp-complete-at-point-menu)
;;
;;
;;
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Usage
;;
;;    To use code completion, open a buffer on a C# source file.  Place
;;    the cursor after a partially-completed statement, and invoke
;;    `cscomp-complete-at-point'. (Normally you would bind that fn to a
;;    particular keystroke, like M-. or M-\.) Uppn invoking that fn,
;;    this module will insert the first completion that matches. If
;;    multiple completions are possible, calling the completion function
;;    again (or pressing the bound key again) will cycle through the
;;    possibilities, similar to the way dabbrev-mode works.
;;
;;    You can alternatively call `cscomp-complete-at-point-menu', to get
;;    a popup menu of the completion choices.
;;
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; How it Works
;;
;;    There are 2 complementary sources of information used to generate the
;;    completion options: introspection into compiled .NET class libraries
;;    (like the base class library), and source code analysis of the
;;    currently-being-edited buffer.  Both sources are facilitated by an
;;    inferior powershell shell running within emacs.  The csharp-completion
;;    module will start a powershell if it is not already running, then load
;;    into that powershell instance a custom library called CscompUtilities.
;;    (The powershell instance with the custom library loaded into it, is
;;    referred to as the CscompShell within this module.)
;;
;;    An example: if you ask for completions on the fragment "System.D",
;;    this elisp module will then call into the CscompUtilities library,
;;    by sending a command-line to the CscompShell that invokes a static
;;    method on the library, to ask the library for possible completions
;;    on the fragment.  The library builds a list of all available types
;;    from the set of referenced assemblies.  It then searches the list
;;    of types to find all possible completions for the given fragment,
;;    and prints the search result, as a string formatted as a lisp
;;    s-expression, on its output.  This elisp module then gathers the
;;    s-expression and evals it, resulting in a structure containing
;;    completion options for the given fragment.
;;
;;    In this example, starting from "System.D", the list of options
;;    returned will include the namespace System.Diagnostics as well as
;;    the type System.DateTime; this module will offer those and the
;;    other options as possible completions.
;;
;;    The latter source of information - source code analysis of the
;;    currently-being-edited buffer - is generated via the NRefactory
;;    library, which ships as part of the open-source SharpDevelop tool.
;;
;;    In the typical case, this module uses both of those sources of
;;    information, together, to generate suggestions for completions.
;;
;;    To illustrate how, consider another example: suppose your code has
;;    a local variable of type System.Xml.XmlDocument, named doc.
;;    Suppose the user asks for completion on the fragment "doc.L",
;;    implying that the user wants to reference a property, method or
;;    field on the doc variable, that begins with the letter L.  The
;;    module uses the source code analysis to identify the name and type
;;    of the local variable.  It then sends a "GetTypeInfo" command to
;;    the CscompShell, passing System.Xml.XmlDocument. The CscompShell
;;    returns a lisp s-expression enumerating the fields, methods and
;;    properties for that type.  This module then filters the
;;    s-expression for members that begin with L, and this filtered list
;;    is then used to populate the completion list, which is either
;;    displayed in a popup menu, or used to cycle the completion
;;    possibilities. The list includes LastChild, LoadXml, the four
;;    Load() overloads and LocalName.
;;
;;
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;;    Here's a summary of the situations in which this module can offer
;;    completions:
;;
;;    a. names of local variables, instance variables, and method arguments.
;;
;;         int lengthOfList;
;;         void Method1(String lengthyArgumentName)
;;         {
;;            leng?
;;         }
;;
;;    b. Methods, fields and properties (m/f/p) on a local variable
;;       with known type, on method arguments of known type, or on
;;       instance variables of known type:
;;
;;         String x = "this is a string";
;;         x.?
;;
;;    c. M/f/p on local variables with var type:
;;
;;         var x = "this is a string";
;;         x.?
;;
;;    d. M/f/p on local variable declarations with dependencies on var types:
;;
;;         var s = "This is a string";
;;         var length = s.Length;
;;         var radix = length.?
;;
;;    e. M/f/p on local variables that are initialized
;;       from instance methods and variables.
;;
;;         void method1()
;;         {
;;             var length = this.InstanceMethod();
;;             length.?
;;         }
;;
;;    f. M/f/p on generic types:
;;
;;         var x = new List<String>();
;;         x.?
;;
;;    g. constructor completion, provide template when completing
;;
;;         var x = new System.String(?
;;
;;    h. constructor completion as above, with unqualified type.
;;       This mode does a search in the namespaces from using clauses.
;;
;;         var x = new TimeSpan(?
;;
;;    i. finding types and namespaces:
;;
;;         var x = new TimeS?
;;
;;    j. complete static methods on known types,
;;       whether fully qualified or unqualified.
;;
;;         String.Jo?
;;
;;    k. present template fpr static methods on known types,
;;       whether fully qualified or unqualified.
;;
;;         String.Join(?
;;
;;    l. Immediate values.
;;
;;         7.C?
;;
;;    m. other compound Expressions:
;;
;;         Path.GetRandomFileName().Normalize().?
;;
;;    n. m/f/p on array types:
;;
;;         var a = new String[];
;;         a.?
;;
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Things that need to be tested or fixed:
;;
;;      return new XmlS?
;;
;;      The module does not do completion on anonymous (var) types declared
;;      within for loops.
;;
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Known bugs/problems :
;;
;;   The NRefractory.dll chokes on incomplete C# source. If the user is
;;   in the middle of writing a for loop, and tries to get completion,
;;   the analysis can simply return nothing, and he'll get no
;;   completions at all. As a result, completion based on the source of
;;   the currently-edited buffer is shaky. I cannot think of a good way
;;   to solve this, other than producing my own AST generator. Yikes.
;;   Not gonna happen.
;;
;;   lacks an installer.
;;
;;   The integration with auto-complete is non-functional.

;;; Revisions:

;; 2012.4.8  2012-April-08 Dino Chiesa
;;
;;    Check for the presence of the Windows SDK. This is required
;;    for the Cscomp.dll to work properly. This necessitates reading
;;    the Windows registry, so there are now new defuns supporting that.
;;
;;    Also now can support completion on array types. Not sure how this
;;    failed before.
;;
;;    Also, update to latest ya-snippet, which required some changes in
;;    completion.

"Generate a fragment of C# source code that can be compiled to
produce IL, which can then be inspected to determine the type of
the var for which the user is asking completion.

This fn generates dummy code that includes placeholders for all
instance members, method arguments, and local variables. The
generated code is then compiled, so that Cscomp can inspect the
resulting IL to determine the type of a local var on which the
user is asking for completion.

Cscomp uses the compiler to determine the type of the var. It
dynamically generates and compiles a class with the same variable
declaration as the code being edited.

The initialization of the var may depend on instance members.  If
so, the compiled class must provide instance members of the
correct type to satisfy those dependencies.  This function
generates C# code to provide those instance members.

For input that looks like this:

  ((var \"staticField1\" \"System.Int32\"
     (modifier \"private static\")
     (location (14 9) (14 20)) (id 17))

   (method \"InstanceMethod1\" \"System.String\"
     (modifier \"public\")
     (params
       (var \"x\" \"System.Int32\" (location (16 29) (16 33)) (id 6))
       (var \"enabled\" \"System.Boolean\" (location (16 36) (16 41)) (id 7)))
     (block ...)
     (location (16 9) (18 10)) (id 9))
    ...
   )

The output will look like this:

    class foo {
      private static int staticField1 = default(int);
      string InstanceMethod1(...) { return default(string); }
      ...
    }

Any void methods will not be emitted because they cannot affect the
types of local variables declared in methods.

"Find the possible completions for a given string, which has

is performed.

SPLIT is a list of (TOKEN1 TOKEN2), as returned from
`cscomp-split-by-dots'.

If the user has typed something followed by a dot, optionally
followed by an fragment after the dot, and then asked for
completions via `cscomp-complete-at-point-menu' or
`cscomp-complete-at-point', then this function gets invoked, with
TOKEN1 containing what precedes the dot, and TOKEN2 containing
what follows the dot. For example, TOKEN1 may be a C# namespace,
a class name, a variable name (local variable or a method or
property or field name on the current class), or explicitly,
\"this\" .  TOKEN2 may be the empty string, or a fragment of a
name, corresponding to a method property or field belonging to
the thing represented by the first token.  The goal is to find a
completion for the second token, given the context of the first
token.

The return value is a list. For example, if the user types the
name of an int variable, then a dot, then asks for completions,
the return value is:

  ((\"CompareTo\" \"(Method) sealed public  (System.Int32 value)  returns System.Int32\")
   (\"CompareTo\" \"(Method) sealed public  (System.Object value)  returns System.Int32\")
   (\"Equals\" \"(Method) sealed public  (System.Int32 obj)  returns System.Boolean\")
   (\"Equals\" \"(Method) public  (System.Object obj)  returns System.Boolean\")
   (\"GetHashCode\" \"(Method) public  ()  returns System.Int32\")
   (\"GetType\" \"(Method) public  ()  returns System.Type\")
   (\"GetTypeCode\" \"(Method) sealed public  ()  returns System.TypeCode\")
   (\"ToString\" \"(Method) sealed public  (System.String format, System.IFormatProvider provider)  returns System.String\")
   (\"ToString\" \"(Method) sealed public  (System.IFormatProvider provider)  returns System.String\")
   (\"ToString\" \"(Method) public  ()  returns System.String\")
   (\"ToString\" \"(Method) public  (System.String format)  returns System.String\"))


Another Example: if the user types System.Diag and asks for completions,
then SPLIT will be (\"System\" \"Diag\") and the returned completion
list will contain \"Diagnostics\".

If the user has simply typed a string, and asked for completions,
then TOKEN1 will be nil and TOKEN2 will contain the string.
This fn then finds possible completions for that single string.

  ;; In most cases, p1 is what precedes the final dot, p2 is what
  ;; follows.  When there is no dot, p1 is nil.  when this is an
  ;; invocation of a constructor, even if the typename contains a dot,
  ;; then p1 is nil and p2 contains "new ZZZ" where ZZZ is the typename,
  ;; with any qualifying namespace.
  ;;
  ;;
  ;; Possibilities:
  ;;
  ;; 1. p1 is a namespace like System.Xml  p2 is empty, or a fragment, like XPa.
  ;;    In this case we need to find types or child namespaces in the given
  ;;    namespace that match the given fragment.
  ;;
  ;; 2. p1 is "this" and p2 is a fragment of a name of a class field/prop/method.
  ;;    In this case, complete on the members of the enclosing class.
  ;;
  ;; 3. p1 is the name of a local variable, and p2 is empty or a fragment.
  ;;    In this case, complete with a field, prop, or method on that variable.
  ;;    Must know or learn the type of the variable in that case.
  ;;
  ;; 4. p1 is nil, and p2 is the partial name of a local variable.
  ;;    In this case, complete with the name of a local field, prop, or method
  ;;    that matches.
  ;;
  ;; 5. p1 is nil, and p2 is "new ZZZ", where ZZZ is the partial name of a type.
  ;;    In this case, complete with the name of a type or namespace
  ;;    that matches the ZZZ portion of p2.
  ;;
  ;; 6. p1 is the name of a type, like System.Console, and p2 is something.
  ;;    In this case, complete with static field, prop, and methods on
  ;;    that type.
  ;;
  ;; 7. p1 is the name of a primitive type, like byte or int.
  ;;    In this case, replace it with the expanded type, and complete as
  ;;    in case 5.
  ;;
  ;; 8. others?
  ;;
  ;; =============================================
  ;;
  ;; There are two sources for completion possibilities.  For known types,
  ;; the possibilities come from introspection, done through the CscompShell.
  ;; So, for System.Xml.XmlDocument, we send a message to the shell and get back
  ;; all the known fields/props/methods of that .NET type. For System.Xml.X, we
  ;; send a message to the CscompShell and get back a list of types and namespaces
  ;; that match.
  ;;
  ;; For unknown types - currently the only "unknown" qualifier is "this." -
  ;; use the source code analysis results to find fields/props/methods.

  "Completes at point.  Performs completion on field, prop or
method names if the thing being completed is a type or instance,
or on namespace members - child namespaces or types - if the
thing being completed is a namespace.

This function is interactive.

Invoking this fn multiple times in succession cycles through the
completions.

On first entry, it finds the completion, by calling out to the
CscompShell by calling `cscomp-find-completion-for-split'.
It then caches the resulting list of completion options into
`cscomp-current-list'.

On subsequent entry, it uses the cached results. After inserting a
completion, this function displays the signature of a method completion
in the minibuffer.

This fn starts the Cscompshell if necessary. Hence, you may
experience a slight delay when using this command for the first
time in a session or when completing a field or method of an
object that has many methods and fields.

See `cscomp-complete-at-point-menu' for an alternative to this command
that lets you select the desired completion from a popup menu.

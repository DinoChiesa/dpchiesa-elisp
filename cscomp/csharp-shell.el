;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   This is code that provides an emacs shell that supports C#
;;   code-completion.  It depends on Powershell.el, which depends on
;;   shell.el.  This module is part of cscomp, a C# completion package.
;;
;;   csharp-shell.el is responsible for starting a PowerShell shell, and
;;   loading a utility assembly, also part of CsComp, into it.  The
;;   running shell can be used as a regular, interactive powershell
;;   shell, but its primary purpose is to receive and process commands
;;   to aid with c# completion. This generally means assembly
;;   reflection.
;;
;;   When the user requests completion on a variable (etc), logic within
;;   csharp-completion.el sends a command to the CscompShell, and gets the
;;   response, in the form of a lisp s-expression.  The logic in
;;   csharp-completion.el then evals that sexp, and does something
;;   intelligent with the result.
;;
;;   The two main public interfaces for this module are:
;;
;;    `csharp-shell-exec-and-eval-result'
;;    `csharp-shell-exec-and-maybe-eval-result'
;;
;;
;;   Some History:
;;   idea of CSDE, the C# Development Environment, was initially
;;   conceived by Matt Bruce in 2001 (or so), and ported from JDE, the
;;   Java Development Environment.
;;
;;   But the ambitious vision of CSDE was never completed. The latest
;;   version is aparently still available on sourceforge, but it was
;;   never updated or maintained.  <URL:http://www.sourceforge.com/>.
;;
;;   Rather than start with "everything", I thought I'd start by
;;   producing a module that did one thing well: code completion.  This
;;   is something like what is known as Intellisense in Microsoft's
;;   Visual Studio.
;;
;;   To do this, I didn't keep any of the old CSDE code. I kept only the
;;   idea of code completion, as well as the idea of using an external
;;   shell to aid in dynamic type and symbol resolution.  This is all
;;   new code.

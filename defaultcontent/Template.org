* Quick HTML5 presentations
The ability to quickly and easily produce HTML5 presentations from
simple text markup is something that already exists in emacs. But you
knew that. 
- Use org-mode and the ox-reveal add-in
- Someone else built this. 
- Emacs users need only to find it, and to learn how to use it.

* Org-mode
Org-mode is a do-it-all mode for taking notes and lots of other things. People
use it to maintain their calendars, to write todo lists, to organize
thoughts. 

1. it has existed in emacs since ???
2. it gets updated independently of, and more frequently than, emacs itself. 
3. it supports unordered lists, ordered lists, hyperlinks, lots of other stuff
4. Get it [[http://orgmode.org][here]]
5. [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht4JtEbFtFI][an overview]]

* More on Org-mode
- In org, you format your notes in a simple markup
| Markup        | effect             |
|---------------+--------------------|
| asterisk      | new slide          |
| dash          | bullet in a list   |
| indented dash | bullet in sub-list |
|               |                    |

 

* You can Export from an Org file
- Exporting from org means transforming org's simple text markup into ... something else
- There are lots of export formats
- a nifty one is provided by the ox-reveal module, which exports to an HTML5 file that uses
  reveal.js
- This presentation was created from [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DinoChiesa/DinoChiesa.github.io/master/test-preso1.org][a 40-line org file]]

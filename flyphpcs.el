;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Inspired by the similar function flymake-phpcs.el, by Sam Graham.
;; But this is independent, and different.
;;  - this installs itself
;;  - puts temporary files in the temporary file directory
;;  - has vars for setting the location of the various phpcs things
;;
;;
;; flyphpcs.el adds support for running PHP_CodeSniffer
;; (http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/) to perform static
;; analysis of a PHP file.
;;
;; Some PHP CodeSniffer basics:
;;
;; To use a custom coding standard, you can create a subdir in the phpcs/Standards
;; directory, and place within that subdir a file named ruleset.xml, with contents
;; like this:
;;
;; <?xml version="1.0"?>
;; <ruleset name="Custom Standard">
;;   <description>My custom coding standard</description>
;;
;;   <rule ref="PEAR">
;;     <exclude name="PEAR.Commenting.ClassComment"/>
;;     <exclude name="PEAR.Commenting.FileComment"/>
;;     <exclude name="PEAR.Commenting.FunctionComment"/>
;;     <exclude name="PEAR.Commenting.InlineComment"/>
;;     <exclude name="PEAR.Classes.ClassDeclaration"/>
;;     <exclude name="PEAR.Functions.FunctionDeclaration.BraceOnSameLine"/>
;;     <exclude name="Generic.Files.LineEndings"/>
;;     <exclude name="Generic.Files.LineLength.TooLong"/>
;;     <exclude name="PEAR.ControlStructures.ControlSignature"/>
;;   </rule>
;;
;;
;;   <rule ref="PEAR.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent">
;;     <properties>
;;       <property name="indent" value="2"/>
;;     </properties>
;;   </rule>
;;
;; </ruleset>

;;; Usage:

;;       fly/phpcs-standard "Zend" ;; PEAR, PHPCS, etc

;; Created    : May 2011
;; Modified   : Oct 2011
;; Version    : 0.2

;;
;; This module defines one interactive function, `httpget', along with
;; a few helper routines it uses, for doing HTTP GETs easily from the
;; minibuffer.
;;
;; THIS MODULE DEPENDS ON AN EXTERNAL WGET PROGRAM, for example see
;; https://cheesoexamples.svn.codeplex.com/svn/wget/wget.cs
;;
;; This function is something like `browse-url-emacs' but more
;; convenient and more interactive and helpful.

(defun httpget (url buffername)
  "Perform an HTTP GET on the given URL, place the result into a
buffer with BUFFERNAME, and pop to that buffer when complete.

This is really handy when you want to use emacs to view a
Javascript file, an rss feed, or an HTML layout available on the
web. Very quickly you can download it and pop open the buffer.

When this fn is called interactively, it prompts for the URL and
buffername. If you have a url at the front of your kill-ring, it
uses that as the default. This is handy, in case you use the OS
\"clipboard\" to copy a url from some other application.  Also,
the default buffername is automatically derived from the
URL. Normally you just need to press <return> twice.  Pretty
quick and easy when called interactively.

In fact, most of the \"value add\" of this function is just the
interactive part.

See also `browse-url-emacs', which is not related, but it similar.

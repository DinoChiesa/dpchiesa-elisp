;;; Commentary:

;; This is a Javascript REPL shell for emacs that depends on Windows and
;; its Cscript.exe host.

;; It was philosophically inspired by Paul Huff's js-comint.el .
;; The code here, though, is not related. It has been partially derived
;; from powershell.el, which is Copyright (C) 2008-2011 Dino Chiesa

;; To Use:
;;   Put jsshell-bundle.el in your load path
;;   Add (require 'jsshell-bundle) to your .emacs
;;   M-x jsshell


;; There are a few customizations you may be interested in. Probably the
;; most interesting and useful is the `jsshell-profile', which is a list
;; of JS modules to load into every JSShell that starts.  You may want
;; to load in json2.js for example, or moment.js or some other library
;; or module. These modules are not supplied as part of jsshell.el.


;;; History:
;;
;; 2012.4.7  2012-April-07  Dino Chiesa
;;    Added simple completion.
;;


;;; More:
;;
;; -- Bundling --
;;
;; This module ships in two forms, "bundled" and "unbundled."  In
;; "unbundled" form, this module depends on on an external file named
;; jsshell.js, which provides the REPL. In bundled form, that code is
;; embedded in the elisp module. To determine if this is a bundled
;; version, scan to the bottom of the module and look for the assignment
;; to `jsshell-js-src'.  If the assignment is there, then this is the
;; bundled version. Usually the bundled version is called
;; jsshell-bundled.el while the core version is called jsshell.el.
;;
;;
;; -- Key mappings --
;;
;; Consider using these key mappnigs:
;;
;;    (local-set-key "\C-x\C-e" 'jsshell-send-last-sexp)
;;    (local-set-key "\C-\M-x"  'jsshell-send-last-sexp-and-pop)
;;    (local-set-key "\C-cb"    'jsshell-send-buffer)
;;    (local-set-key "\C-c\C-b" 'jsshell-send-buffer-and-pop)

(defun jsshell (&optional buffer)
  "Run an inferior Javascript shell, with I/O through tne named
BUFFER (which defaults to `*JSShell*').

Interactively, a prefix arg means to prompt for BUFFER.

If BUFFER exists but the shell process is not running, it makes a new shell.

If BUFFER exists and the shell process is running, just switch to BUFFER.

See the help for `shell' for more details.  \(Type
\\[describe-mode] in the shell buffer for a list of commands.)

The shell is CSCRIPT.exe (see `jsshell-location-of-cscript-exe'),
which runs a Javascript program that implements a
Read-Execute-Print Loop (REPL). This function looks for the
source for the REPL program first as a string stored in
`jsshell-js-src'. This variable will be non-nil when running the
shell from the bundle version of jsshell.  If that variable nil,
this function gets the source for the REPL from
`jsshell-location-of-jsshell-js'.

NB: Literal strings typed into the shell buffer need extra escaping.
This is espcially a problem with regex strings. eg, a \d in a JS
regex gets transformed into just a d when run through the
jsshell.  I think this is not a problem when loading files with
`jsshell-load-file'. The problem may not be worth fixing.

(defun jsshell--prompt-seeking-output-filter (string)
  "This function is intended for use only internally to the jsshell
package.

It gets installed as a comint output filter upon initialization
of a jsshell. Its purpose is to negotiate the I/O protocol the
shell uses to manage multi-line input.

Normally, the Javascript REPL evals each line of input
independently. In some cases, such as with functions that are
defined over multiple lines, the user of the REPL wants to defer
eval until after all the input is ready.

For accepting multiline input, the Javascript REPL applies this
convention: one empty line signals the beginning of a multi-line
input block, and 2 empty lines signal the end of the block. This
multi-line input is what is used to load an entire JS file into
the shell, for example.

This filter function manages that protocol, keeping in mind the
state of this module, specifically whether there are additional
files waiting to be loaded.  When expecting a prompt after
loading a multi-line block, this filter send a nudge to the
shell (essentially a newline). When not expecting a prompt, and
there are files to be loaded, this filter loads the next file.

The nudging happens only when sending chunks of data via
`jsshell-send-region' or `jsshell-load-file', which are typically
bound to keyboard sequences.

When the shell is in actual interactive use - that is to say when
a person is typing input directly into the shell buffer - this
function does not get called. The human is expected to enter the
necessary double newlines at the appropriate times.

distribution option. This function produces that one file.

Most people will never need to use this function. It's useful only
after modifying either the original jsshell.el or the jsshell.js file,

;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides `smarter-compile' function.

;; It acts as a wrapper for `compile', providing a way to
;; intelligently set the `compile-command' and then invoke
;; `compile' as normal.

;; It chooses a compile command, and suggests it by invoking `compile'
;; interactively. It makes the choice according to the name of the
;; current buffer, and the items - think of them as rules - in the
;; `smart-compile-alits'. By default, it performs the selection logic
;; just once per buffer. When you run `smarter-compile', it sets a
;; buffer-local flag and does not walk the rules again.  If you'd like
;; to force to walk through the rules, use C-u M-x smarter-compile.

;; The built-in rules are like this:
;;
;;  - If there is a makefile in the current directory, ask if the user
;;    wants to run make, and if so, suggest make.

;;  - If there is a Msbuild project file in the current directory,
;;    suggest msbuild.exe .

;;  - if there is a comment in the header like compile: <...>, and
;;    the file has an extension that is a member of
;;    `smart-compile-compile-command-in-comments-extension-list', then
;;    use that string that as the compile command.

;;  - if editing a makefile, suggest make.

;;  - if the file extension is .cs, .vb, .c, .java, and so on...
;;    use a module-specific build command.

;; To use this package, add this line to your .emacs file:
;;     (require 'smart-compile)

;; To tweak it, set `smart-compile-alist'. This variable holds the rules
;; for guessing the compile command.  It is a list of cons cells, each
;; one like (TEST . COMMAND). In the simplest case, the TEST is a regex
;; that gets applied to the filename, and COMMAND is a string used for
;; the `compile-command' when the TEST succeeds.  You can either setq
;; the list, which would replacing the built-in rules completely, or you
;; can append items to the default list, thereby extending the built-in
;; behavior of `smarter-compile.el'. Keep in mind that the order of
;; evaluation of the rules is significant.

;; The simplest kind of extension of the rules looks like this:

;; (require 'smarter-compile)
;; (add-to-list
;;   'smart-compile-alist
;;   '("\\.css\\'"   .   "/bin/csslint.js --format=compiler %f"))

;;; More Details:
;;
;; That example uses a string for both the TEST and the COMMAND.
;; But there are other options.  TEST can be:
;;
;;   - a string. In this case it is used as a regex,
;;     and test against the filename associated to the
;;     buffer. The TEST succeeds when the regex matches.
;;
;;   - a symbol, representing the major-mode. In this case
;;     if the buffer uses that major mode, the TEST
;;     succeeds.
;;
;;   - a symbol, representing any function with a name not
;;     ending in \"-mode\". In this case, the function is
;;     called and if it returns non-nil, the TEST
;;     succeeds.
;;
;;   - a list of forms. In this case the forms are eval'd,
;;     and if the return value is non-nil, the TEST
;;     succeeds.
;;
;; COMMAND can be:
;;
;;   - a string. This is used as a template to generate the
;;     actual shell command. `smarter-compile` will replace these
;;     opcodes in the string.
;;
;;       %M  make program                 ( nmake.exe or make )
;;       %F  absolute pathname            ( /usr/home/dev/Module.c )
;;       %f  file name without directory  ( Module.c )
;;       %n  file name without extension  ( Module )
;;       %c  classname                    ( com.example.foo.Module )
;;       %e  extension of file name       ( c )
;;       %t  current time in 24-hr format ( 12:44:18 )
;;       %d  current date                 ( 2012-Mar-20 )
;;
;;     `smart-compile.el' sets `compile-command' to the string with
;;     all the replacements.
;;
;;     With no opcodes, the COMMAND string is used directly
;;     as `compile-command'.
;;
;;   - a symbol, representing a function. In this case the
;;     return value of the function should be a string. It is
;;     expanded as described above, and the expansion is then
;;     used as the `compile-command'.
;;
;;   - a list of forms. In this case the list is eval'd, and
;;     the return value should be a string. It is
;;     expanded as described above, and the expansion is then
;;     used as the `compile-command'.
;;
;; Again, when extending, remember that the ordering of the rules is
;; important. For example, the default ruleset in smarter-compile
;; includes a test that returns true if a makefile is present in the
;; current directory.  There is also a rule that returns true if the
;; file extension is .c.  When both conditions are true, the order of
;; these rules in the list determines which of the rules will apply.
;;
;; Rather than adding new rules, you may wish to replace existing rules
;; in `smart-compile-alist'.  There's a convenience function for this
;; purpose. It inserts or replaces as appropriate:
;;
;; (require 'smarter-compile)
;; (smart-compile-insert-simple-rule
;;   "\\.css\\'"  "/bin/csslint.js --format=compiler %f")
;;
;; `smart-compile-insert-simple-rule' works best when the test is a
;; string.

  "List of cons cells, each one (TEST . COMMAND).

COMMAND is used for the `compile-command' when
the TEST succeeds.

Test can be:

  - a string. In this case it is used as a regex,
    and matched against the filename associated to the
    buffer. The TEST succeeds when the regex matches.

  - a symbol, representing the major-mode. In this case
    if the buffer uses that major mode, the TEST
    succeeds.

  - a symbol, representing any function with a name not
    ending in \"-mode\". In this case, the function is
    called and if it returns non-nil, the TEST
    succeeds.

  - a list of forms.  In this case the forms are eval'd,
    and if the return value is non-nil, the TEST
    succeeds.

The ordering of tests is important. The first test that
succeeds will be the one used for a particular buffer.

COMMAND can be:

  - a string. This is used as a template to generate the
    actual shell command. These opcodes will be replaced
    in the string.

      %M  make program                 ( nmake.exe or make )
      %F  absolute pathname            ( /usr/local/bin/Module.c )

      %d  current date                 ( 2012-Mar-20 )

    `smart-compile.el' sets `compile-command' to the string with
    all the replacements.

    With no opcodes, the COMMAND string is used directly
    as `compile-command'.

  - nil. In this case the result of the TEST is used for
    the compile command. This makes sense when the TEST
    is a function or list of forms.

  - a symbol, representing a function. In this case the
    return value of the function should be a string. It is
    expanded as described above, and the expansion is then
    used as the `compile-command'.

  - a list of forms. In this case the list is eval'd, and
    the return value should be a string. It is
    expanded as described above, and the expansion is then
    used as the `compile-command'.

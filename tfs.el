;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Basic steps to setup:
;;   1. Place `tfs.el' in your `load-path'.
;;   2. In your .emacs file:
;;        (require 'tfs)
;;        (setq tfs/tf-exe  "c:\\vs2010\\common7\\ide\\tf.exe")
;;        (setq tfs/login "/login:domain\\userid,password")
;;              -or-
;;        (setq tfs/login (getenv "TFSLOGIN"))
;;   3. also in your .emacs file:
;;        set local or global key bindings for tfs commands.  like so:
;;
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xvo" 'tfs/checkout)
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xvi" 'tfs/checkin)
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xvp" 'tfs/properties)
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xvr" 'tfs/rename)
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xvg" 'tfs/get)
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xvh" 'tfs/history)
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xvu" 'tfs/undo)
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xvd" 'tfs/diff)
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xv-" 'tfs/delete)
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xv+" 'tfs/add)
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xvs" 'tfs/status)
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xva" 'tfs/annotate)
;;        (global-set-key  "\C-xvw" 'tfs/workitem)

The file to undo is deteremined this way:

 - if FILENAME is specified, then this function selects that file.

 - When this function is called from a buffer that is in
   `dired-mode', it selects the file on the current line.

 - when there is a file backing the current buffer, it selects
   the file being visited by the current buffer.

 - else, prompt the user for the file.

The undo happens only when the file is writable. Confirms before
discarding edits.

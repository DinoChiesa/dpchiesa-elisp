;;; Commentary:

;; This module allows a user to look up synonyms for a word in
;; a web-accessible thesaurus.

;; This code started with a basic version posted without license at
;; http://alexhenning.github.com/blog/2010/11/01/synonym.el/

;; I standardized the naming, re-factored, wrote some documentation,
;; introduced the dependency on dropdown-list.el and x-popup-menu, added
;; a license, introduced some error handling, and polished it.

;; Right now it depends on a web service from Big Huge Labs. It
;; is not tied to that service, and could be expanded to use other
;; services, and to even dynamically choose which service to access.

;; To use, first go to http://words.bighugelabs.com/ and register (no
;; cost) to get an API key. Then, put thesaurus.el in your emacs load
;; path and modify your .emacs to do this:

;;   (require 'thesaurus)
;;   (setq thesaurus-bhl-api-key "XXXXXXXXXXXX")  ;; from registration

;;    -or-

;;   (require 'thesaurus)
;;   (thesaurus-set-bhl-api-key-from-file "~/BigHugeLabs.apikey.txt")

;; Optionally, set a key binding:
;; (define-key global-map (kbd "C-x t") 'thesaurus-choose-synonym-and-replace)

;; This module currently relies on a BigHugeLabs thesaurus service. The
;; service is currently free, and has a limit of 10,000 lookups per
;; day. If the service changes, or becomes unavailable, or if anyone
;; exceeds the limit, it shouldn't be difficult to expand this module to
;; support other online thesaurus services. Wolfram Alpha is one
;; possible option; theirs is a free API. Wordnik has a free synonyms API.
;;
;; eg:
;; http://api.wordnik.com//v4/word.json/awry/relatedWords?relationshipTypes=synonym
;;
;; I think Bing has one. Probably there are others. This module would need
;; to be modified to support one of those.
;;
;; If you want to proxy the URL calls, then use this:
;;   (setq url-proxy-services (list (cons "http" "proxyHost:proxyPort")))

;;
;;; Revisions:
;;
;; 2012.11.25  2012-November-25 Dino Chiesa
;;    Add the helper method `thesaurus-set-bhl-api-key-from-file'.
;;    A few doc changes.
;;
;; 2012.4.7  2012-April-07 Dino Chiesa
;;    Fixup the customization group.
;;    Also serialize and de-serialize the cache as a list, not as a
;;    hash. To avoid the problem reported by Takafumi Arakaki. (Thanks!)
;;
;; 1.0.4  2012-March-30  Dino Chiesa
;;    use message-box to notify users when they need to acquire an api
;;    key, and pop a browser to do so. Use a special message-box on
;;    Windows.  Also, handle the case where no synonyms are found - for
;;    example, when looking up a mis-spelled or non-existent word.
;;
;; 1.0.3  2012-March-30  Dino Chiesa
;;    include x-popup-menu as the default prompting mechanism.
;;    dropdown-list is sort of a pain to work with. I don't know
;;    what this means for tty users.
;;
;; 1.0.2  2012-March-29  Dino Chiesa
;;    tiny doc change
;;
;; 1.0.1  2012-March-29  Dino Chiesa
;;    Initial version
